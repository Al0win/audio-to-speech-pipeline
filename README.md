# Intelligent Data Pipeline
### It is a part of [Vakyansh's](https://open-speech-ekstep.github.io/mkdocs/) recipes to build state of the art Speech Recogniition Model
This will hold the data pipeline to convert raw audio data to speech which will act as input dataset for speech-to-text pipeline

## Key Highlights

- **Automated**: Vakyansh's pipelines are fully automated and no human intervention is required to process 
  the audio pipelines. It uses pre trained models to identify language, gender and speakers in the audio.
- **Scalable**: Process thousands of hours of data in 2-3 days leveraging K8s capabilities. Allows faster time to market.
- **Versatile**: Vakyansh's pipelines can run on any VM's or Kubernetes cluster on any cloud. 
  For scalability it is recommended to run on Kubernetes
- **Quality**: Vakyansh lays strong emphasis on code quality and high test
  coverage to ensure its seamless use and continued maintenance.
